# Example

Add your script references

    <script src="jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="jquery.formwarden-pack.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Place an additional script tag just inside of the close body tag.

    <script>
        $(function(){
         var validationOptions= 
            {
              fields:{

                "email":[{isValid:"required", message:"Email is required"},
                          {isValid:"email", message:"Email must be valid"}],

                "firstName":[{isValid: "required", message: "First Name is required"},
                              {isValid:function(value, form){ return value.length < 25; }, message:"First Name must be less than 25 characters"}],
              }
            };
        $("form").validation(validationOptions);
      });
    </script>
